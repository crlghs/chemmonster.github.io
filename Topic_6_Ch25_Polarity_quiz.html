                { question: "What is electronegativity?", options: ["The energy required to remove an electron", "The ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons in a covalent bond", "The size of an atom", "The charge of an atom's nucleus"], answer: "The ability of an atom to attract bonding electrons in a covalent bond", explanation: "Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons." },
                { question: "How does electronegativity generally change across a period from left to right?", options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It increases then decreases"], answer: "It increases", explanation: "Across a period, the nuclear charge increases while the shielding remains similar, pulling bonding electrons more strongly." },
                { question: "How does electronegativity generally change down a group?", options: ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same", "It decreases then increases"], answer: "It decreases", explanation: "Down a group, the bonding electrons are further from the nucleus and shielded by more electron shells, resulting in a weaker attraction." },
                { question: "Which of the following is the most electronegative element?", options: ["Oxygen (O)", "Chlorine (Cl)", "Fluorine (F)", "Nitrogen (N)"], answer: "Fluorine (F)", explanation: "Fluorine is the most electronegative element on the periodic table." },
                { question: "True or False: Noble gases are typically assigned the highest electronegativity values.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "Noble gases are often not assigned electronegativity values because they rarely form chemical bonds due to their stable electron configurations." },
                { question: "A covalent bond formed between two identical atoms (e.g., in H₂) is always...", options: ["Polar", "Non-polar", "Ionic", "Metallic"], answer: "Non-polar", explanation: "When two identical atoms bond, they have the same electronegativity and share the bonding electrons equally, creating a non-polar bond." },
                { question: "A P-H bond is considered non-polar. What does this imply about the electronegativity of Phosphorus and Hydrogen?", options: ["Phosphorus is much more electronegative", "Hydrogen is much more electronegative", "Their electronegativity values are very similar", "They cannot form a bond"], answer: "Their electronegativity values are very similar", explanation: "Bonds are non-polar when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is very small or zero." },
                { question: "In a polar covalent bond, the more electronegative atom gains a...", options: ["Full positive charge", "Partial positive charge (δ+)", "Full negative charge", "Partial negative charge (δ-)"], answer: "Partial negative charge (δ-)", explanation: "The bonding electrons are pulled closer to the more electronegative atom, giving it a slight excess of negative charge (δ-)." },
                { question: "Which of the following bonds is the most polar?", options: ["H-F", "H-Cl", "H-Br", "H-I"], answer: "H-F", explanation: "The polarity of a bond is determined by the difference in electronegativity. Fluorine has the highest electronegativity, so the H-F bond has the largest electronegativity difference and is the most polar." },
                { question: "What is a dipole moment?", options: ["The moment an atom becomes an ion", "A measure of the overall charge of a molecule", "A measure of the polarity of a covalent bond", "The force between two molecules"], answer: "A measure of the polarity of a covalent bond", explanation: "A dipole moment is a vector quantity that measures the separation of positive and negative charges in a polar bond." },
                { question: "True or False: A molecule that contains polar bonds must be a polar molecule.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "False", explanation: "A molecule with polar bonds can be non-polar if its shape is symmetrical, causing the individual bond dipoles to cancel each other out (e.g., CCl₄)." },
                { question: "The CO₂ molecule is linear and non-polar. Why?", options: ["The C=O bonds are non-polar.", "Oxygen is not very electronegative.", "The two polar C=O bonds are symmetrical and their bond polarities cancel out.", "The molecule is a gas."], answer: "The two polar C=O bonds are symmetrical and their bond polarities cancel out.", explanation: "Although each C=O bond is polar, the molecule's linear shape (O=C=O) means the two bond dipoles point in opposite directions and cancel each other completely." },
                { question: "The water molecule (H₂O) is polar because...", options: ["The O-H bonds are non-polar.", "It has a linear shape.", "It has a V-shaped (bent) and the bond polarities of O-H bonds do not cancel out.", "Oxygen is only slightly more electronegative than hydrogen."], answer: "It has a V-shaped (bent) and the bond polarities of O-H bonds do not cancel out.", explanation: "The two O-H bonds are polar, and the bent shape of the molecule means the bond dipoles add together to create a net dipole moment." },
                { question: "Which of these molecules is non-polar?", options: ["NH₃", "CHCl₃", "BF₃", "H₂O"], answer: "BF₃", explanation: "BF₃ has a symmetrical trigonal planar shape. The three polar B-F bonds are arranged at 120° angles, and their dipole moments cancel each other out." },
                { question: "Why is an ammonia (NH₃) molecule polar?", options: ["It has a symmetrical trigonal planar shape.", "The N-H bonds are non-polar.", "It has a trigonal pyramidal shape, so the bond polarities of N-H bonds do not cancel out.", "Nitrogen is less electronegative than hydrogen."], answer: "It has a trigonal pyramidal shape, so the bond polarities of N-H bonds do not cancel out.", explanation: "The trigonal pyramidal shape is asymmetrical, meaning the individual N-H bond dipoles do not cancel, resulting in a net dipole moment for the molecule." },
                { question: "Is the carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) molecule polar or non-polar?", options: ["Polar", "Non-polar"], answer: "Non-polar", explanation: "Despite having four polar C-Cl bonds, the tetrahedral shape is perfectly symmetrical. The four bond dipoles point to the corners of the tetrahedron and cancel each other out." },
                { question: "Which of the following molecules is polar?", options: ["CH₄", "SF₆", "PCl₃", "BeCl₂"], answer: "PCl₃", explanation: "PCl₃ has a trigonal pyramidal shape due to a lone pair on the phosphorus atom, making it asymmetrical and polar. The others (CH₄, SF₆, BeCl₂) are all symmetrical and non-polar." },
                { question: "Is the CH₂Cl₂ molecule polar or non-polar?", options: ["Polar", "Non-polar"], answer: "Polar", explanation: "Although the shape is tetrahedral, the bonds are not identical (two C-H and two C-Cl). This leads to an unsymmetrical distribution of charge and a net dipole moment." },
                { question: "True or False: All hydrocarbon molecules (like CH₄ and C₂H₆) are considered non-polar.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "The electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is very small, making C-H bonds essentially non-polar. Combined with their symmetrical shapes, this makes hydrocarbons non-polar molecules." },
                { question: "If a molecule has only one polar bond, the molecule is...", options: ["Always polar", "Always non-polar", "Sometimes polar", "Cannot be determined"], answer: "Always polar", explanation: "If there is only one polar bond, there are no other bond dipoles to cancel it out. Therefore, the molecule will always have a net dipole moment and be polar (e.g., HCl)." },
                { question: "Is the SF₆ molecule polar or non-polar?", options: ["Polar", "Non-polar"], answer: "Non-polar", explanation: "The octahedral shape is perfectly symmetrical. The six polar S-F bonds point to the vertices of the octahedron, and their dipole moments cancel each other out completely." },
                { question: "Which two factors determine the polarity of a molecule?", options: ["Atomic mass and bond length", "Number of neutrons and molecular shape", "Bond polarity and molecular shape", "Melting point and boiling point"], answer: "Bond polarity and molecular shape", explanation: "You must consider both whether the bonds are polar and how those polar bonds are arranged in 3D space (the molecule's geometry)." },
                { question: "The molecule OCS is linear. Is it polar or non-polar?", options: ["Polar", "Non-polar"], answer: "Polar", explanation: "Even though it's linear, the C=O bond is more polar than the C=S bond. Since the dipole moments are unequal, they do not cancel out, and the molecule is polar." },
                { question: "Which of these molecules has a net dipole moment of zero?", options: ["H₂S", "SO₂", "SiCl₄", "CH₃Cl"], answer: "SiCl₄", explanation: "SiCl₄ is the only symmetrical molecule in the list. The four polar Si-Cl bonds are arranged symmetrically in a tetrahedral shape, causing their dipoles to cancel." },
                { question: "Why is methanol (CH₃OH) a polar molecule?", options: ["It contains carbon.", "The C-H bonds are strongly polar.", "The O-H bond is highly polar and the molecule is asymmetrical.", "It is a liquid at room temperature."], answer: "The O-H bond is highly polar and the molecule is asymmetrical.", explanation: "The highly polar C-O and O-H bonds, combined with the molecule's overall asymmetrical shape, result in a strong net dipole moment." },
                { question: "When a positively charged rod is brought near a jet of a polar liquid like water, what happens?", options: ["The jet is repelled", "The jet is attracted", "Nothing happens", "The jet turns into steam"], answer: "The jet is attracted", explanation: "The partial negative ends (δ-) of the polar water molecules are attracted to the positive rod, causing the entire stream of liquid to bend towards it." },
                { question: "What would happen if a charged rod were brought near a jet of non-polar tetrachloromethane (CCl₄)?", options: ["The jet would be strongly attracted", "The jet would be weakly attracted", "The jet would be repelled", "The jet would not be deflected"], answer: "The jet would not be deflected", explanation: "Since CCl₄ molecules are non-polar, they have no permanent dipole to be attracted to the charged rod, so the stream of liquid flows straight down." },
                { question: "True or False: Both a positively charged rod and a negatively charged rod will attract a stream of a polar liquid.", options: ["True", "False"], answer: "True", explanation: "A positive rod attracts the negative ends of the molecules. A negative rod attracts the positive ends. In either case, the result is a net attraction that deflects the stream." },
                { question: "The deflection of a liquid jet by a charged rod is a test for...", options: ["The liquid's density", "The liquid's boiling point", "The presence of ions in the liquid", "The polarity of the liquid's molecules"], answer: "The polarity of the liquid's molecules", explanation: "This classic experiment demonstrates the effect of an electrostatic field on molecular dipoles, providing a simple visual test for molecular polarity." },
