                <h3>Key Concepts for Chemical Selection</h3>
                <p>When choosing chemicals to prepare salts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>For soluble salts:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use acid + metal/insoluble base/insoluble carbonate (excess solid can be filtered)</li>
                            <li>For group I/ammonium salts: use titration (acid + alkali/soluble carbonate)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>For insoluble salts:</strong> Mix solutions containing the required ions (precipitation)</li>
                    <li><strong>Key considerations:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reactants must provide the correct ions</li>
                            <li>Method must allow for separation/purification</li>
                            <li>Safety (avoid violent reactions)</li>
                        </ul>

                    <strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B<br>
                    <strong>Explanation:</strong> Zinc chloride can be prepared by reacting zinc oxide (an insoluble base) with hydrochloric acid. The excess zinc oxide can be filtered off, and the solution can be evaporated to obtain crystals. The other options either wouldn't react or would produce different salts.
